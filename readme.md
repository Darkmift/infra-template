# ðŸ›  FS Template (WIP README)

This project is a comprehensive template that integrates several technologies including Husky, TypeScript, Express, React, Vite, and Playwright.

## Description

This project serves as a starting point for building web applications. It combines a variety of technologies to provide a robust, full-stack development environment. Here's a brief overview of the technologies used:

- **Husky**: Used for enforcing code quality by running linters and tests before commits and pushes.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds types and other features to the language.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications.
- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **Playwright**: A Node.js library to automate the Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox browsers with a single API. It enables cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable and fast.
